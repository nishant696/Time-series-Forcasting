# Favorita Store Sales Prediction

## Introduction

Welcome to the Favorita Store Sales Prediction competition! In this competition, participants are tasked with predicting sales for thousands of product families sold at Favorita stores located in Ecuador. The training dataset includes time series data consisting of features such as store number, product family, promotion status, and sales numbers. Additional supplementary files are provided to aid in building predictive models.

## Problem Statement

The objective of the competition is to develop machine learning models that accurately forecast sales for different product families at Favorita stores. Accurate sales predictions are essential for optimizing inventory management, ensuring sufficient stock levels, and maximizing revenue potential. Participants are provided with historical sales data, store metadata, oil prices, and holiday events data to facilitate model development.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset provided for this competition includes the following files:

- **train.csv**: Training data containing time series information for store number, product family, promotion status, and sales numbers.
- **test.csv**: Test data with the same features as the training data, used for predicting sales for future dates.
- **sample_submission.csv**: A sample submission file in the correct format for submitting predictions.
- **stores.csv**: Store metadata, including city, state, store type, and cluster.
- **oil.csv**: Daily oil prices, encompassing both the train and test data timeframes.
- **holidays_events.csv**: Holidays and events data, including metadata such as holiday type and transfer information.

## Data Field Information

- **store_nbr**: Identifies the store at which the products are sold.
- **family**: Identifies the type of product sold.
- **sales**: Total sales for a product family at a particular store on a given date.
- **onpromotion**: Total number of items in a product family that were being promoted at a store on a given date.
- **cluster**: Grouping of similar stores.
- **oil_price**: Daily oil price, affecting the economic health of Ecuador.

## Additional Notes

- Wages in the public sector are paid bi-weekly on the 15th and the last day of the month, potentially impacting supermarket sales.
- A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Ecuador on April 16, 2016, affecting supermarket sales for several weeks due to relief efforts and donation drives.

## Potential Impact

Successful models developed in this competition could have several positive impacts:

- Enhanced inventory management: Accurate sales forecasts can help retailers optimize inventory levels and minimize stockouts or overstocking.
- Improved revenue generation: Optimized pricing and promotion strategies based on sales predictions can maximize revenue potential.
- Disaster response preparedness: Insights from sales data during the earthquake period can inform disaster response planning for future events.

## Getting Started

1. **Data Exploration**: Familiarize yourself with the dataset by exploring its features, distributions, and relationships.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or preprocess existing ones to improve model performance.
3. **Model Development**: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms and time series forecasting techniques.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of developed models using appropriate metrics and cross-validation techniques.
5. **Submission**: Submit your predictions for evaluation on the competition platform.

## Conclusion

The Favorita Store Sales Prediction competition provides an opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world problem in retail. By accurately forecasting sales, participants can contribute to improving inventory management, revenue generation, and disaster response preparedness for grocery retailers in Ecuador.

Happy forecasting! ðŸ›’ðŸ“ˆ
